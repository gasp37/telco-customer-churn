# Telephone Company Customer Churn (using PySpark)

In this project, we will analyze a dataframe containing variables related to clients of a telephone company, including social features, contracts, payments, and services. Our goal is to create a classification model that can predict customers likely to churn, enabling us to proactively address and improve customer satisfaction. By identifying potential churners, we can implement strategies to retain them and improve their overall experience.

## **Project Steps:**
**Step 0 - Formulate hypotheses**

Formulate hypotheses regarding relations between the many variables and the churn target variable. These hypotheses will be tested and answered throughout the project.

**Step 1 - Analysis:**

Initial Jupyter Notebook with an analysis of data relations and distribution.

**Step 2 - Create ML model script:**

Pre-process data, train models, evaluate models, and export results.

**Step 3 - Choose the best model, train it, and export predictions:**

Based on the results exported in step 2, choose the one with the best performance.

Create a script that trains the best model, predicts its training data set, and exports the results

**Step 4 - Answer hypotheses and create visuals**

Answer the hypotheses that were created in Step 0, and create a dashboard that can answer those questions.

## **Step 0 - Formulate hypotheses**

Below you will find a few hypotheses that will be tested and answered:
- The variables in the dataframe hold predictive power in determining whether a customer has churned or not. We'll consider this hypothesis valid if we can create a model with 70% accuracy rate.
- What variables present the strongest influence on a customer leaving the company?
